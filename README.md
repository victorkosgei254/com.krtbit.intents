## Lucky number : Android app 2
This is a demo application to reinforce my learning, in this demo

1. Receive username
2. If username is empty, show a toast message asking the user who the lucky number belongs to
3. Use explicit intents to pass data from the first activity to the second
4. In the second activity, extract data from intent, display some
5. Give the user option to regenerate the lucky number
6. User can share their lucky number explicit intent
